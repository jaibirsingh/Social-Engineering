## Ways
* Impersonation
* Pretexting
  * Pretexting is a form of social engineering where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario or pretext to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information, performing certain actions, or providing access to secure areas or systems.
  * The attacker typically creates a believable and plausible scenario to gain the trust of the target. This might involve impersonating someone trusted or using a credible-sounding reason to obtain information.
  * Pretexting often involves extensive research on the target and the creation of a detailed and convincing story to deceive the victim.
  * For instance, an attacker might pretend to be an employee, a customer, a vendor, or even a person in authority such as a manager, IT support staff, or someone from a trusted organization.
  * They could contact individuals via phone, email, or in person, and through manipulation or deception, extract sensitive information like passwords, account details, or access to systems.
  * Pretexting relies heavily on human psychology and social interaction, exploiting trust and often catching victims off guard by seeming legitimate or by playing on emotions such as urgency, fear, or the desire to be helpful.
  * Organizations often train their employees to recognize and respond appropriately to pretexting attempts as part of their cybersecurity awareness programs.
    
* Emotional pull
* Urgency

* Blackmail/Extortion
* Quid pro quo
  * The term "quid pro quo" itself is Latin for "something for something" or "this for that."
